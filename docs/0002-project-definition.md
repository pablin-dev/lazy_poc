## Why this project

### Necessity

**Celestine Sloth Society** wants to have his own blockchain to evolve his main product NFT collection.

### Problematic

Since Celestine Sloth Society have his NFT Collection on other blockchains, there is a limit on what this NFT can do in terms of functionality.

### How we are going to proceed

We are going to use a **modular blockchain** using **Sovereign Rollups** using Artela EVM++ as **Execution Layer**, **Rollkit** as **Settlement and consensus** layer (**cometBFT**) and **Celestia** as **Data Availability** layer.

## Decision

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do, and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
